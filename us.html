                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Us, I gotta admit, I was writing this at July 5 at night. You just asked me what I
                    was doing but I told you that it was a secret. And the reason for the late writing is because it took me a lot of time to
                    prepare this. Do you know, you do but I’ll say this again, I was cheesily looking for you already way before I met you. And
                    that day we met, it feels like my breath is frozen. But from then I knew, that my heart found its home. I, loved you since
                    then. I’ve spent, probably <b>A THOUSAND YEARS</b>, looking for you. And I’ll spend a thousand more, just to be with you.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since that day, <b>I DON'T WANT TO MISS HER THINGS</b>. It is as if I wanted to stay
                    awake 24/7, to see you when you sleep. Because I’m afraid that I’ll miss something of key importance about you. I wanna know
                    more about you. I didn’t run away, or hide like my torpe me used to do, kasi I know na I wouldn’t wanna miss moments spent
                    with you is like.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so I spent days, showing you just how much I loved you. And I’ll be glad to
                    spend a lot more, but at that fateful day, more than 3 months ago. You’ve given me your yes. That was the happiest I’ve ever
                    been. I am so happy that finally, I can say, that <b>I’M YOURS</b>. My mind, filled with nothing but joy and love. My heart, beating
                    so fast in a 2/4 beat. Each one sounding “Yan”.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since then, we’ve spent more time together and as each passing days. I just
                    <b>CAN’T HELP FALLING IN LOVE</b> a lot more with you. You’ve given me your everything. And now, you are my everything. Everything
                    that I don’t even know how to repay it. So by then, I want you to take my hand, and even take my whole life too. I’ll give
                    you everything I can give. Everything that you deserves.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ll give you everything, a good house, a good life, a good car, a good family, a
                    good clothes like a versace. Everything, something that won’t even match the idea of you giving your body to me. Heck, even
                    if I give you those things, once we throw the <b>VERSACE ON THE FLOOR</b> once again. I will once again have no idea just how could
                    I repay you. I just, love you that much and I wanna treasure you.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may have some troubles. Arguments a few but when we did, they do nothing but
                    strengthen us and give us something to learn more about one another. We have done things we sorta had extreme anxieties
                    right after, we even almost regretted everything. But again as usual. I will be there, I won’t leave you on your roughest
                    times, on our roughest times, on my roughest times. It’s just that, <b>YOU ARE THE REASON</b> I keep on living.  I love you tangi
                    ko sobrang sobra.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I honestly couldn’t even see myself loving anybody else but you. I want us to spend
                    a lot more time together. I will keep working hard and smart, so we can someday be together. I want us to be <b>HAPPY TOGETHER</b>.
                    I just, wanna spend the rest of my life with you.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ll support you along the way. I’ll keep on loving you and I’ll keep on ensuring
                    that you’ll be as happy as you can be. I envision us together in the future. I envision us getting married. I can see you
                    <b>BEAUTIFUL IN WHITE</b>. I can see us raising kids. I can see us working hard for them. I can see them leaving our place to find
                    their own life. And I can see us growing old together.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you may have probably noticed, I highlighted some words that are, well, song
                    titles. These songs are the reason why it took me a long time to make this. I made a playlist, songs that represents the
                    two of us. Our relationship so far, and just how much we can still experience more, and just how much I wanna we can love
                    each other a lot more. I love you sobrang sobra my tangi kong Yanyan. I hope you’ll enjoy this.
