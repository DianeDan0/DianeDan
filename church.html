                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Church, a place I can't wait to be with you at. I always enjoyed our time going at church.
                    I still do. It's just that I feel incredibly at ease knowing that I prayed for your safety every week. Knowing that someone is out there,
                    someone omnipotent who is powerful enough to ensure that things will be easier for you everyday. Someone who will guide you with every
                    actions you'll have to do, with every decisions you'll have to take. I just love that you will be okay, even when I'm not there with you.

                            <p>“You have made my heart beat faster, my sister, my bride;<br>
                                You have made my heart beat faster with a single glance of your eyes.”

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was possibly the most romantic bible verse I've ever read (I totally didn't search "most romantic bible verse" at google).
                    There is a trendy question before. What is your favorite hail song. I'd answer, God gave me you. I know it is not a hail song whatsoever, pero everytime we set foot at
                    the church, I just couldn't thank God enough for you, being there for me. I just don't know how to repay him fully for giving me someone I've been looking for, for a lot
                    of time. It is interesting that I, someone who was actually incredibly bored at church before. Get incredibly excited of the idea of going at it with you. Its just, as
                    the verse stated, you made my heart beat faster, my soon to be bride. You made my heart beat faster with a single glance of your eyes. By the way, a little fun fact,
                    all my prayers are actually meant for you. This feels like a segment of church, it got the word of God and homily is here as well lmao. Well, I just wanna say, thank
                    God for giving you to me. In return, I'll do everything to treasure this gift that is you. I love you sobrang sobra, my yanyan ko.
