            Welcome to this (not so) engrande celebration that I cooked for you. I am your INCREDIBLY HANDSOME boyfriend. Please agree, I need this hehe. Anyways, I'll explain how this entire thing will work. 
            <br><br>
            So later this day, I will give you a red packet envelope. It will contain 7 packets that I need you to open at certain days. This will contain some polaroid pictures of the two of us that I prepared. Also a code at the back of em.
            <br><br>
            Anyways, the entire process will work like this. On this website's URL: 
            <br><br>
            (Contain URL)
            <br><br>
            You'll have to add "/(code)" at the end of it. It will basically lead you to another page that I created. What awaits you with em? Well, get excited.
            <br><br>
            I know how excited you gets so I won't release the pages until the proper date for them. But, in order to maintain the experience I'm trying to go for. Don't open them until the dates given.

            <br><br>
            Why don't we give this a try?
            <br><br>
            Your code for today will be: "<span class="code">third</span>".
