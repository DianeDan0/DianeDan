                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School, but, on break. I made a separate one, long before Sunday. But I have to change
                    it, so I can communicate with you somehow. I, I’m having a really hard time tangi. I tried really hard to distract myself: I
                    became an honorable postknight; I became a friend to the wizard island; earning their trust. But now, I don’t know. I am possible
                    spiraling down in depression, and so do you. I can’t even do shit for fuck sake. Both metaphorically and literally. I don’t have
                    the energy to do anything. I can’t make myself happy right now. 
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the thing is, you feel it too. You’re having a hard time as well, you can’t even
                    sleep. I don’t know, we both don’t know pero we just know na what we had is wrong. It’s as if, we’ve advanced too far in the
                    level stages, na the enemies are just incredibly strong na and we’re still, level 1s. Di natin kinakaya kahit sabihin nating 
                    aging strategic tau with every moves. It’s incredibly, overwhelming. Pero that doesn’t change the fact na love na love kita.
                    I came to a point na palabas na ako. Naligo na, nagbihis na, pupunta na sa simbahan. Sana. Pero naalala kong mas kailangan mo
                    tong cool off na to kesa sa kailangan kong makita kita. I think, saan tayo nagkamali is hindi na natin nagawang maging masaya
                    ng magisa, naging dependent na tau with each other. Enough to make us anxious, sad, afraid when we’re alone. The only thing
                    that keeps me going is the thought of making you happy.  Before I met you, I was incredibly alone, aimless, walang balak sa
                    buhay. I always think na if I ever met someone, that is probably when I’ll be able to find the path I’m searching for. But
                    the path I found was the path where I have to ensure your happiness a hundred percent. Like dedicate my everything to you.
                    Which we both know is wrong. I need to be able to figure out what my path should be. I have to learn who I am when I  only
                    have myself. Because then, you will be able to see, and understand who I really am.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t even know if you’re reading this. I just, wanna know if you’re okay. I just
                    wanna say something that hopefully helps you understand yourself much better. Cause I hate this na, pero we have to keep moving.
                    I hope that things work out great in the end. Btw, as I wrote this at Sunday, where we had a little talk. It honestly made me
                    happy. Incredibly, specially when we did promised to give ourselves 3 days. I’m incredibly excited for it. Anyways, I love you,
                    sobrang sobra. I’ll never not love you.
