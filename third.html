            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HAPPY 3rd MONTHSARY SA ATIN YANYAN KO!!!, tangi ko. So uhh, for today. I know this is a bit lousy. Kasi why are you receiving only a message for our 3rd Monthsary. Well, the overall experience talaga yung gusto kong maenjoy mo.
            It will take quite a long time. Pero sana maging patient ka with all this stuff. Anyways, done with the introduction. I'll be going with my message.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a very common belief. It states na the true love do exist and it will come with us all. One thing lang na di ko alam before talaga is what love means. I came to conclusion na before I'll discover it, I'll have to learn how to
            truly love myself first. That on itself took me years to do and until now hindi parin ako tapos. It is incredibly interesting to me na nahanap na kita before it happened. But that's when I realized, love is not really something that would end when you achieve it. It is
            something that one person choose to do everyday. Love, is something I choose to have for you every single day.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know how much you've been suffering with life on itself. I know it is not something na mawawala lng bigla when I say na I love you pero I still want you to know na every I love you na binibigay ko is sincere. This won't help nga 
            pero I hope na you'll choose to keep pushing, knowing na I love you sobrang sobra. I hope na you'll keep choosing to love. Love me ofcourse, pero Love yourself, should be your priority. We've had our ups and downs pero I am very happy na we remain strong after everything.
            I truly can't express how much I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you. You know kasi, Loving you, is something na di ko kayang maipaliwanag. Para bang, "    ". Charot lang, pero legit, kulang ung mga salita sa diksyonaryo upang maexpress ko sau kung gaano kita talaga
            kamahal. Well, as always yanyan ko. I'll always be here when you need me. I won't hope anymore na mas maging open ka sakin with your sufferings kasi I realize na you'll have to learn how to deal with them yourself. Pero just, if you needed your very handsome na boyfriend's help,
            andito lang ako. I love you sobrang sobra. Sana maenjoy mo tong week na to.
