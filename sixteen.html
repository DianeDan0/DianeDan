                <p>Gulat ka no, di mo siguro inexpect na may new entry ako dito. Whahahaha, New style din although not as great whahha. Pero I adopted some of the learning I got since the last time. Anyways, you got here not because I wanna flex my learnings. You got here because I wanna tell you a lot of things.

                    At the moment youre reading this, we are at our 16th Monthsary. And we’ve been through a lot for the last month. Sobrang grabe ung pinagdaan nating pain, specially ikaw. I really broke your heart too much. I’m truly sorry for that yan. I got this last chance and I will really cherish it.
                    <br><br>
                    You know why I am still fighting for us, its because u never stopped fighting for us as well. You couldve easily ghosted me like u did with your exes. You couldve chosen not to protect me from tita. Yet you did. Kasi you still love me. And I really love you for that. I love you na you still love me enough to give me another chance with our relationship. Another chance to prove to you na I love you talaga ng sobrang sobra. 
                    <br><br>
                    It’s gonna take time, Im sure of that, pero I hope I can gain your trust back for the last time. I really cant afford to lose you yan. I dont know what I am without you anymore. Im afraid na Ill lose ung katinuan ko if I lose you. Im that crazy for you tangi ko. You lose yourself fighting for me tangi. Pero I promise you na I’ll win us back.
                    <br><br>
                    I know na walang new picture akong prepared for this and message lng talga. Straight to the point, pero like I said po, me doing what u wanted me to do in the first place is gonna be how I'll win you back. Not by Doing a lot of this. but by loving you truly. Again, tangi ko. I love you po sobrang sobra. Aking bulaklak na nalalanta. Susubukang isalba. Pagkat Mahal na mahal kita.
