                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gift, do you know how many gifts I’ve obtained my whole life. It’s not much, it can
                    be counted with my fingers and toes. But out of all of them. The best gift I’ve ever obtained is you. I appreciate you and I
                    wanna treasure you too much.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanna go a bit and recall our gifts so far. The very first one would be our
                    bracelet. One thing about it that I actually am proud of is how I still have it in my hand. After all this months. I still
                    have it in my hand. I used to try wearing bracelets before and none of em last at all. My hand got irritated incredibly but
                    now, my hand feels empty without it. I gotta be honest tho, I almost lost it a lot before but I still managed to find it so
                    it’s still great.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the best gift I’ve received is your folding cube gift. I love it but what I
                    love about it is what the message in it is. That is the gift you’ve given me for giving me your yes. It’s so incredibly
                    precious to me. You are precious to me. I still occasionally play with that cube when I’m really bored. Another gift I
                    received from you was the letter from our first monthsary. It still manage to make me tear up when I read it alone. At the
                    same time, I gave you an art that, didn’t work as intended at all. Whahhaha.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our second monthsary, I got you a letter, with secret message inside of it. That
                    letter is actually really fun to do. You may have not given me anything that day pero it is not at all important because all
                    I really wanted is you. However, I feel extremely guilty when you tapon your gift for our 3rd monthsary. I really wanna say
                    sorry so I went above and beyond with this gift. A week long gift. I really hope you’ll enjoy this. I don’t know how I can
                    improve my gift for next month whahaha.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the best gift, as I stated, is you. You’ve given me everything you could ever
                    give. I might be thinking about how I can top this week long gift off, pero what I truly don’t know what to do is how I could
                    everything you’ve given me. I really really appreciate you tangi. Love na love kita, sobrang sobra.
                    <br><br>
                    P.s. I wrote this, way before our monthsary so di ko alam na di mo pala tinapon ung gift. And you went way above and beyond
                    din with it. I truly appreciate them tangi. Thank you a lot. I love you sobrang sobra.
                    <br><br>
                    P.P.s. Di na mabibilang with my hands and toes lahat ng gift na natanggap ko my whole life. Whahhaah.
                    <br><br>
                    P.P.P.s. I love you sobrang sobra
